# GPT-2 Fine-tuning for Chat-like Interactions

This project contains the necessary files and scripts to fine-tune a GPT-2 model for chat-like interactions. Below is a description of each file in the project:

## Files

1. `gpt2_chat_finetuning.py`
   - Main Python script for fine-tuning the GPT-2 model.
   - Contains the data loading, model training, and evaluation logic.
   - Includes a custom `ChatDataset` class for handling chat data.

2. `requirements.txt`
   - Lists all the Python libraries required for this project.
   - Use this file to install dependencies with pip.

3. `data/chat_data.txt` (you need to create this)
   - Your chat dataset file.
   - Each line should represent a complete conversation or exchange.

4. `README.md` (this file)
   - Provides an overview of the project and its components.

## Setup and Usage

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Prepare your chat data and place it in `data/chat_data.txt`.

3. Run the fine-tuning script:
   ```
   python gpt2_chat_finetuning.py
   ```

4. The fine-tuned model will be saved in a directory specified in the script (default is 'path/to/save/fine_tuned_model').

## Customization

- Adjust hyperparameters in `gpt2_chat_finetuning.py` as needed (e.g., learning rate, batch size, number of epochs).
- Modify the `prepare_data` function in `gpt2_chat_finetuning.py` to suit your specific data format.

## Note

Ensure you have sufficient computational resources, preferably a GPU, for training the model efficiently.
